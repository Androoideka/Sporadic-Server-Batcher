# Sporadic-Server-Batcher
RAF SRV 2020 Project - FreeRTOS Sporadic Server GUI

This is a GUI implemented in JavaFX for configuring a simulated real-time system provided by the <a href="https://github.com/Androoideka/FreeRTOS-Sporadic-Server">FreeRTOS Sporadic Server repository<a/>. The app contains the Batcher View, Settings View and Stats View sections. Batcher View allows creating multiple task configurations that can be selected together and sent with a button's press, while persisting them across multiple runs of the real-time simulation. Settings View allows starting and stopping the system, configuring system settings like the stat writing interval and server parameters, and viewing and cancelling currently active tasks in the system. Stats View provides a visual overview of the system's actions during each tick, including which task is currently active on the processor, which aperiodic tasks will be arriving, and the current capacity of the server.
